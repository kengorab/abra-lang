# `ext` Directory

This directory contains any external libs/dependencies needed in order to generate binaries from Abra source files.
This includes [`qbe`](https://c9x.me/compile/) (which is downloaded and built within `../build_qbe.sh`). The built
`qbe` binary is not checked in; it must be built using `../build_qbe.sh`.
